## Background

The Serena Android app is designed to assist users in detecting their mood by capturing and sending photos. The app recognizes seven emotions â€“ anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness, and surprise. These emotions are further categorized into two moods: energetic and relaxed. The color scheme, featuring soothing green and cream tones, reflects a sense of calmness and nature. Serena goes beyond mood detection; it suggests diffuser settings based on the user's emotional state. Additionally, the app includes a song recommendation feature and a marketplace, though the latter is still in development. The app aims to enhance users' well-being by seamlessly integrating mood detection with lifestyle recommendations.
