## Background

The Serena Android application is designed to help users to automatically turn on the diffuser accordingly based on the user's mood by taking and sending photos. The app recognizes seven emotions â€“ anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness and surprise. These emotions are further categorized into two moods: energetic and relaxed. The color scheme, featuring soothing greens and creams, reflects a sense of calm and nature. Serena does more than just detect mood; it suggests diffuser settings based on the user's emotional state. Additionally, the app includes song recommendation features and markets, although those markets are still under development. The app aims to improve user well-being by integrating mood detection with lifestyle recommendations.
